      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a former Marine Corps Communications Officer who got out of the service in 2020 after 6.5 years of service. I am a huge fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers! My beautiful wife, Jessica, is a dental hygienist. We have two lovely dogs - Cisco and Cloud (yes we have a tech name-theme going on!)</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up in a small suburb of Los Angeles, CA. Growing up, my parents had a liquor store in the heart of Los Angeles and I feel deeply connected with the city. My dream is to see Los Angeles flourish and for poverty to be erradicated in the area. </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love working on cars, I own a Toyota 86 and Toyota Tacoma. I spend considerable amounts of time modifying both; it truly is an art and passion for me!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is to one day be the CEO of my own tech company; I would like to employ a cadre of ethical folks who want to use technology to improve the world.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Temecula, CA.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>The world is increasingly moving towards a full 'Internet of Things' concept. I feel that all major companies need to employ dedicated and well-versed full stack developers who have a deep knowledge of cybersecurity and can create websites beneficial to both the small business owner and the major corporation.</p>
